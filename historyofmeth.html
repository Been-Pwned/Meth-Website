      <h1>The Backstory of Meth</h1>
      <h4><i> The past that harrows fear </i></h4></center>

      <p>Methamphetamine has a fairly long history. As a drug, it was created by Japan in 1919. It was used by many people in WW2. It obviously kept the soldiers awake, but past that it gets stranger. Before I get to that point I would like to mention why I am writing this section. The primary reason I am writing this section is that when you know something's history you understand its creation and what it has done to others. I am sure there were thousands perhaps millions harmed by meths past. Especially from the point, I am about to recount. After its use in WW2 meth become popular again in the 1950s, but for a different reason. It was prescribed as a <b>diet aid</b> and also used by college students to stay awake. It ran rampant in the US for 20 years before it became mostly illegal in the 1970s. At this point, its illegal production was mostly controlled by biker gangs. Though in the 1990s it was taken over by Mexican drug agencies. Millions of profits have been made off of its time to run rampant. Now that you know how meth came to its height as at you can help to make a country-wide decision. End its 100 years of use or allow it to harm more.</p></center>

      <h3>There are many ways to get help. Howevery meth has a very low recovery rate. So the best option is almost always to not use at all. Howevery, if help is required it usually costs $5,000$-10,000 a month for out of house treatment. Or around $30,000 a month for in-house treatment. Even then success rate is very low. </h3>
